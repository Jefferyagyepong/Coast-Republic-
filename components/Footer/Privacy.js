            decision-making that has a legal or otherwise significant effect
            using customer data. Our processor Shopify uses limited automated
            decision-making to prevent fraud that does not have a legal or
            otherwise significant effect on you. Services that include elements
            of automated decision-making include: Temporary blacklist of IP
            addresses associated with repeated failed transactions. This
            blacklist persists for a small number of hours. Temporary blacklist
            of credit cards associated with blacklisted IP addresses. This
