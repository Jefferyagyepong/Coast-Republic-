        <h2>Returns</h2>
        <p>
          We have a **30-day return policy**, which means you have 30 days after
          receiving your item to request a return.
        </p>
        <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unused and in the same condition that you received it</li>
          <li>In its original packaging</li>
          <li>Accompanied by a receipt or proof of purchase</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Once we receive your return, we will inspect it and notify you of the
          status. If approved, your refund will be processed within **5-7
          business days** to your original payment method.
        </p>

        <h2>Exchanges</h2>
